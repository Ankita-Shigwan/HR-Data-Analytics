# üß† Employee Attrition Prediction using Machine Learning

This project analyzes employee attrition using machine learning models to help HR departments identify employees who are likely to leave and understand the key factors driving attrition.

---

## üìå Project Overview

- **Dataset**: `Human_Resources.csv`  
- **Goal**: Predict whether an employee will leave the company  
- **Target Variable**: `Attrition` (Yes/No ‚Üí 1/0)

## üõ†Ô∏è Models Used & Accuracy

| Model                   | Accuracy (%)     |
|------------------------|------------------|
| Logistic Regression     | 84.78            |
| Random Forest           | 84.78            |
| XGBoost Classifier      | 84.51            |
| K-Nearest Neighbors     | 83.97            |
| **Support Vector Machine** | **85.87 ‚úÖ**  |

> ‚úÖ **SVM** achieved the highest accuracy and was used as the final classifier.  
> üß© **XGBoost** was used to extract feature importance and interpret business drivers of attrition.
